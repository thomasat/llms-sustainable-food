Ingredients: corned beef brisket, peppercorn, cabbage, fresh carrot, fresh parsley, real butter, fresh garlic clove, sweet onion, yellow mustard, N .y. C. Irish Soda Bread.
Instructions: ------------Selecting the corned beef brisket------------. Go to the store several days ahead of time or you will have to pick out the best of what has been picked over again and again. The best will disappear first. Do not freeze. Pick out a nice thick slab checking the sides to make sure it isn't a very gristly one. Feel it because some butchers fold it over hiding the gristle if there is a lot of it. There will always be some gristle and it runs the length of the slab in the center. The thicker the slab the better. If you are lucky you may see some chunk style at a higher price per pound. If there isn't a spice bag in with the brisket you will need to get some whole peppercorns (white and black) and bay leaves. ------------Selecting the Cabbage-------------------. The heavier and more solid it is the better it is. Smell it to make sure it isn't too bitter. You may have to go to another store if the whole batch has a very strong bitter smell. I have had to visit several stores to find a decent batch. Keep in mind that the outer leaves will be discarded even if the store has already removed the natural outer leaves to make them look better and fresher. --------------Selecting the Potatoes----------------. Watch out for the red dyed ones. Pick out a bag of medium to small sized ones. The smaller the better. If you are lucky enough to find the ones as small as salad tomatoes they are the best. -------------Selecting the Carrots----------. Get the smallest bag they have unless you like carrots because you will only use one per pot of cabbage to take any bitterness out of the cabbage. Serving a bowl of carrots is a big no no on Saint Patrick's Day. Preparing and cooking the meal-----------------------. (It's going to take 3 hours with you there). Use a large Dutch oven or stock pot that will hold everything all at once. Place the brisket (best side up) in the bottom of the pot. There's no need to rinse it because nothing bad will survive what you are about to do to it and you will remove the outer marinate. Add the spice packet or a teaspoonful of peppercorns and two bay leaves. Cover the brisket generously with water and a bottle of beer (optional - adds flavor and is a tenderizer). Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 2 hours. During the 2 hours------------------------. Scrub and rinse the new red potatoes. Remove any eyes and bad spots. Leave as much of the peel as you can. Quarter them (halve or whole if tiny). Cover with water until ready for them. Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage until the leaves are entirely light green rinse and cut it into quarters through the spine so they stay together.  Set aside. Peel one carrot and cut it into quarters.  Set aside. Peel the onion and cut it into eighths.  Set aside. Rinse the bunch of fresh parsley and chop up just the tops into very tiny pieces. I find that kitchen scissors do just fine. After the 2 hours----------------------. Add the potatoes on top of the brisket. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the cabbage on top of the potatoes and add onion and carrot on top of the cabbage. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Check the cabbage to see if it is tender. If not simmer another 5 minutes. You shouldn't undercook it and it's hard to overcook it. When done-----------------------. In a large serving bowl where you can stir the potatoes crush the garlic clove and rub the inside of the bowl with it. Place the potatoes in the bowl while still piping hot and add (at least) a quarter pound of butter and add a handful (more is better than less) of chopped fresh parsley. Gently stir until butter is melted it coats all the potato pieces and the parsley is evenly distributed. Put the rest of the parsley into a tiny serving bowl for those who want to add more to their potatoes. As I said more is better. Slice the brisket cross grain. Hope there is leftovers for breakfast. See my March 18th Breakfast! It's a family tradition. We make sure we make enough to ensure leftovers for breakfast the next morning. Finely chopped fried corned beef and cabbage (the entire meal) and coffee is divine. We throw in any leftover parsley.","Crock Pot Corned Beef and Cabbage

Instructions: Pre-heat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5. Lightly oil an oven proof dish with the teaspoon of olive oil - using a pastry brush is best. Place one chicken breast between a large piece of cling film and gently beat it  with a cook's mallet - beating until large and fairly thin - try NOT make any holes in the chicken! Repeat with the second chicken breast. Place the chicken breasts on a work board and spread half the Boursin cheese on each chicken piece - make sure it is spread evenly right up to the edges. Roll the chicken breasts up - tucking the last small \""fillet\"" flap up and into the stuffed roll. Wrap the bacon pieces or pancetta ham around the stuffed chicken making sure they do not overlap too much and the edges are sealed underneath. Gently lift them into the oiled oven dish. Season well with freshly ground black pepper. (Season with salt to taste - the bacon will make it quite salty so watch out when seasoning with salt.). If using the lemon juice pour over the top of the chicken breasts now. Scatter or arrange the cherry tomatoes around the chicken pieces. (I like to keep them on the vine.). Place in the middle of a pre-heated oven and roast for between 45 - 55 minutes; the cooking time depends on the size of the chicken breasts and your oven. Remove from the oven and place the chicken breasts on a plate - you can serve them whole or sliced. Garnish with watercress as well as the roasted cherry tomatoes. Serve with a selection of seasonal fresh vegetables and a jacket potato making sure you spoon the excess Boursin sauce over the top of the chicken pieces and the roasted cherry tomatoes! Tip:You can make an optional creamy sauce. On taking the chicken out of the oven add the creme fraiche and white wine to the Boursin cooking juices in the oven dish whisk together and then gently heat whisking all the time over medium heat on top of the stove or decant the creme fraiche wine and juices to a small saucepan and heat the sauce in the pan. (Make sure to keep the chicken warm whilst you do this.). TO FREEZE: As soon as you have stuffed and wrapped the bacon around the beaten chicken breasts wrap individually in cling film and put into a freezer container or a freezer bag. Take them out as required and allow to defrost for 4-5 hours at room temperature or overnight in the fridge. Cook as above.

Ingredients: corned beef brisket, peppercorn, cabbage, fresh carrot, fresh parsley, real butter, fresh garlic clove, sweet onion, yellow mustard, N .y. C. Irish Soda Bread.
Instructions: ------------Selecting the corned beef brisket------------. Go to the store several days ahead of time or you will have to pick out the best of what has been picked over again and again. The best will disappear first. Do not freeze. Pick out a nice thick slab checking the sides to make sure it isn't a very gristly one. Feel it because some butchers fold it over hiding the gristle if there is a lot of it. There will always be some gristle and it runs the length of the slab in the center. The thicker the slab the better. If you are lucky you may see some chunk style at a higher price per pound. If there isn't a spice bag in with the brisket you will need to get some whole peppercorns (white and black) and bay leaves. ------------Selecting the Cabbage-------------------. The heavier and more solid it is the better it is. Smell it to make sure it isn't too bitter. You may have to go to another store if the whole batch has a very strong bitter smell. I have had to visit several stores to find a decent batch. Keep in mind that the outer leaves will be discarded even if the store has already removed the natural outer leaves to make them look better and fresher. --------------Selecting the Potatoes----------------. Watch out for the red dyed ones. Pick out a bag of medium to small sized ones. The smaller the better. If you are lucky enough to find the ones as small as salad tomatoes they are the best. -------------Selecting the Carrots----------. Get the smallest bag they have unless you like carrots because you will only use one per pot of cabbage to take any bitterness out of the cabbage. Serving a bowl of carrots is a big no no on Saint Patrick's Day. Preparing and cooking the meal-----------------------. (It's going to take 3 hours with you there). Use a large Dutch oven or stock pot that will hold everything all at once. Place the brisket (best side up) in the bottom of the pot. There's no need to rinse it because nothing bad will survive what you are about to do to it and you will remove the outer marinate. Add the spice packet or a teaspoonful of peppercorns and two bay leaves. Cover the brisket generously with water and a bottle of beer (optional - adds flavor and is a tenderizer). Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 2 hours. During the 2 hours------------------------. Scrub and rinse the new red potatoes. Remove any eyes and bad spots. Leave as much of the peel as you can. Quarter them (halve or whole if tiny). Cover with water until ready for them. Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage until the leaves are entirely light green rinse and cut it into quarters through the spine so they stay together.  Set aside. Peel one carrot and cut it into quarters.  Set aside. Peel the onion and cut it into eighths.  Set aside. Rinse the bunch of fresh parsley and chop up just the tops into very tiny pieces. I find that kitchen scissors do just fine. After the 2 hours----------------------. Add the potatoes on top of the brisket. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the cabbage on top of the potatoes and add onion and carrot on top of the cabbage. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Check the cabbage to see if it is tender. If not simmer another 5 minutes. You shouldn't undercook it and it's hard to overcook it. When done-----------------------. In a large serving bowl where you can stir the potatoes crush the garlic clove and rub the inside of the bowl with it. Place the potatoes in the bowl while still piping hot and add (at least) a quarter pound of butter and add a handful (more is better than less) of chopped fresh parsley. Gently stir until butter is melted it coats all the potato pieces and the parsley is evenly distributed. Put the rest of the parsley into a tiny serving bowl for those who want to add more to their potatoes. As I said more is better. Slice the brisket cross grain. Hope there is leftovers for breakfast. See my March 18th Breakfast! It's a family tradition. We make sure we make enough to ensure leftovers for breakfast the next morning. Finely chopped fried corned beef and cabbage (the entire meal) and coffee is divine. We throw in any leftover parsley.","Cabbage and Noodles

Ingredients: boneless skinless chicken breasts, boursin cheese, smoked streaky bacon, pancetta, olive oil, cherry tomatoes, salt, fresh ground black pepper, creme fraiche, white wine, watercress.
Instructions: Pre-heat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5. Lightly oil an oven proof dish with the teaspoon of olive oil - using a pastry brush is best. Place one chicken breast between a large piece of cling film and gently beat it  with a cook's mallet - beating until large and fairly thin - try NOT make any holes in the chicken! Repeat with the second chicken breast. Place the chicken breasts on a work board and spread half the Boursin cheese on each chicken piece - make sure it is spread evenly right up to the edges. Roll the chicken breasts up - tucking the last small \""fillet\"" flap up and into the stuffed roll. Wrap the bacon pieces or pancetta ham around the stuffed chicken making sure they do not overlap too much and the edges are sealed underneath. Gently lift them into the oiled oven dish. Season well with freshly ground black pepper. (Season with salt to taste - the bacon will make it quite salty so watch out when seasoning with salt.). If using the lemon juice pour over the top of the chicken breasts now. Scatter or arrange the cherry tomatoes around the chicken pieces. (I like to keep them on the vine.). Place in the middle of a pre-heated oven and roast for between 45 - 55 minutes; the cooking time depends on the size of the chicken breasts and your oven. Remove from the oven and place the chicken breasts on a plate - you can serve them whole or sliced. Garnish with watercress as well as the roasted cherry tomatoes. Serve with a selection of seasonal fresh vegetables and a jacket potato making sure you spoon the excess Boursin sauce over the top of the chicken pieces and the roasted cherry tomatoes! Tip:You can make an optional creamy sauce. On taking the chicken out of the oven add the creme fraiche and white wine to the Boursin cooking juices in the oven dish whisk together and then gently heat whisking all the time over medium heat on top of the stove or decant the creme fraiche wine and juices to a small saucepan and heat the sauce in the pan. (Make sure to keep the chicken warm whilst you do this.). TO FREEZE: As soon as you have stuffed and wrapped the bacon around the beaten chicken breasts wrap individually in cling film and put into a freezer container or a freezer bag. Take them out as required and allow to defrost for 4-5 hours at room temperature or overnight in the fridge. Cook as above. Can be frozen for up to 3 months with no adverse effects on the Boursin cheese.",4.156521739130435,4.6923076923076925,2.0,NO,NO,NO,NO,0.5357859531772577,0,non-vegetarian vs non-vegetarian,non-vegan vs non-vegan

Ingredients: white button mushrooms, cream cheese, sausage, butter.
Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 Fahrenheit. Separate caps and stems while cleaning the mushrooms. If cleaning with water let them drain for a bit. Start cooking the sausage in frying pan at a medium to medium/high temperature. While the sausage is cooking put the cream cheese into a mixing bowl so it can soften and mince the stem pieces. Spice the sausage to taste.  Garlic is a good addition. Just before the sausage is done add the stem pieces and finish cooking. Drain off the excess grease and add the sausage/stem mixture into the cream cheese. Mix together well using a wooden spoon or your hands.  Be careful as it will be rather hot. Set the caps into a 13x9 pan (or larger) with sides. Optional! Melt enough butter to just put a little in the bottom of each cap or just brush some over the top of each after they're filled.  You can put any extra butter in the bottom of the pan. Fill the caps with the cream cheese/sausage/stem mix. Add a small amount of water to the bottom of the pan just enough to cover the bottom. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes or until the tops are crusty and the mushrooms have turned dark. Scoop them out of the pan with a slotted spoon and arrange them on a plate. Serve warm.  They reheat well so you can make them ahead of time. *VARIATION 1: Add dried bread crumbs to the mix to make a larger batch without adding more cream cheese or sausage. Onions are also another popular addition. *VARIATION 2: Use one 8oz. box of cream cheese to two 8oz. pkgs of sausage.  It makes for a larger batch that is less rich and tastes just as good. *FUN HINTS: The cream cheese mix is also very good on bread or crackers! This comes in handy if you you think there might be someone who doesn't like mushrooms - save some of the mix to the side for them to dip with.","Stupid Easy Crock Pot / Slow Cooker Sausage &amp; Potatoes

Tip the honey & spiced stock into the crock pot & mix well. Add the cinnamon stick. Add the tinned tomatoes dates & prunes to the crock pot - mix well. Heat up the remaining olive oil and brown the beef cubes in small batches to sear & seal them. As you finish browning them add the beef to the crock pot. When you have finished browning all the beef give the whole mixture a good stir & season with salt & pepper. Cook on high for between 6 & 10 hours depending on your crock pot's wattage & settings. Serve the beef tagine with fluffy couscous and garnish with the chopped fresh coriander & toasted flaked almonds. It also works well with rice too. P.S. Watch out for the cinnamon stick!

Ingredients: corned beef brisket, peppercorn, cabbage, fresh carrot, fresh parsley, real butter, fresh garlic clove, sweet onion, yellow mustard, N .y. C. Irish Soda Bread.
Instructions: ------------Selecting the corned beef brisket------------. Go to the store several days ahead of time or you will have to pick out the best of what has been picked over again and again. The best will disappear first. Do not freeze. Pick out a nice thick slab checking the sides to make sure it isn't a very gristly one. Feel it because some butchers fold it over hiding the gristle if there is a lot of it. There will always be some gristle and it runs the length of the slab in the center. The thicker the slab the better. If you are lucky you may see some chunk style at a higher price per pound. If there isn't a spice bag in with the brisket you will need to get some whole peppercorns (white and black) and bay leaves. ------------Selecting the Cabbage-------------------. The heavier and more solid it is the better it is. Smell it to make sure it isn't too bitter. You may have to go to another store if the whole batch has a very strong bitter smell. I have had to visit several stores to find a decent batch. Keep in mind that the outer leaves will be discarded even if the store has already removed the natural outer leaves to make them look better and fresher. --------------Selecting the Potatoes----------------. Watch out for the red dyed ones. Pick out a bag of medium to small sized ones. The smaller the better. If you are lucky enough to find the ones as small as salad tomatoes they are the best. -------------Selecting the Carrots----------. Get the smallest bag they have unless you like carrots because you will only use one per pot of cabbage to take any bitterness out of the cabbage. Serving a bowl of carrots is a big no no on Saint Patrick's Day. Preparing and cooking the meal-----------------------. (It's going to take 3 hours with you there). Use a large Dutch oven or stock pot that will hold everything all at once. Place the brisket (best side up) in the bottom of the pot. There's no need to rinse it because nothing bad will survive what you are about to do to it and you will remove the outer marinate. Add the spice packet or a teaspoonful of peppercorns and two bay leaves. Cover the brisket generously with water and a bottle of beer (optional - adds flavor and is a tenderizer). Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 2 hours. During the 2 hours------------------------. Scrub and rinse the new red potatoes. Remove any eyes and bad spots. Leave as much of the peel as you can. Quarter them (halve or whole if tiny). Cover with water until ready for them. Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage until the leaves are entirely light green rinse and cut it into quarters through the spine so they stay together.  Set aside. Peel one carrot and cut it into quarters.  Set aside. Peel the onion and cut it into eighths.  Set aside. Rinse the bunch of fresh parsley and chop up just the tops into very tiny pieces. I find that kitchen scissors do just fine. After the 2 hours----------------------. Add the potatoes on top of the brisket. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the cabbage on top of the potatoes and add onion and carrot on top of the cabbage. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Check the cabbage to see if it is tender. If not simmer another 5 minutes. You shouldn't undercook it and it's hard to overcook it. When done-----------------------. In a large serving bowl where you can stir the potatoes crush the garlic clove and rub the inside of the bowl with it. Place the potatoes in the bowl while still piping hot and add (at least) a quarter pound of butter and add a handful (more is better than less) of chopped fresh parsley. Gently stir until butter is melted it coats all the potato pieces and the parsley is evenly distributed. Put the rest of the parsley into a tiny serving bowl for those who want to add more to their potatoes. As I said more is better. Slice the brisket cross grain. Hope there is leftovers for breakfast. See my March 18th Breakfast! It's a family tradition. We make sure we make enough to ensure leftovers for breakfast the next morning. Finely chopped fried corned beef and cabbage (the entire meal) and coffee is divine. We throw in any leftover parsley.",4.384615384615385,3.835714285714286,1.0,NO,NO,NO,NO,0.5489010989010992,0,non-vegetarian vs non-vegetarian,non-vegan vs non-vegan

Fry chips for about 3 minutes until soft but NOT coloured. Drain and shake well and set to one side. Put some flour onto a plate. Dredge the fish fillets in the flour thoroughly - this is VERY important it stops the batter sliding off when fried! Leave the fish fillets in the flour whilst you make the batter. Some people say you should make the batter at least one hour before - I have found little difference - so make it before if it is convenient or now! Put flour bicarbonate of soda salt and pepper into a large roomy bowl. Add the beer gradually stop when you have a thick coating type of batter. Drink any beer that is left! Whisk thoroughly until it is smooth and there are no lumps.Add the lemon juice OR a splash of malt vinegar if desired. Mix thoroughly again. Have your plates newspaper or whatever ready for eating! Adjust deep fat fryer to fish frying temperature of 160°C. Take one fillet of fish at a time and holding it by the tail or thin end (!) swirl it around the batter until well coated - plunge into hot fat immediately. As soon as it has crisped up and set add your other fillets one at a time taking out the first ones as they cook - about 6 to 10 minutes depending on the thickness. Place onto a tray and keep warm in the oven. Turn up the heat setting to 190°C again and cook your chips until golden and crisp. Serve on plates or newspaper with salt & vinegar!

Ingredients: boneless skinless chicken breasts, boursin cheese, smoked streaky bacon, pancetta, olive oil, cherry tomatoes, salt, fresh ground black pepper, creme fraiche, white wine, watercress.
Instructions: Pre-heat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5. Lightly oil an oven proof dish with the teaspoon of olive oil - using a pastry brush is best. Place one chicken breast between a large piece of cling film and gently beat it  with a cook's mallet - beating until large and fairly thin - try NOT make any holes in the chicken! Repeat with the second chicken breast. Place the chicken breasts on a work board and spread half the Boursin cheese on each chicken piece - make sure it is spread evenly right up to the edges. Roll the chicken breasts up - tucking the last small \""fillet\"" flap up and into the stuffed roll. Wrap the bacon pieces or pancetta ham around the stuffed chicken making sure they do not overlap too much and the edges are sealed underneath. Gently lift them into the oiled oven dish. Season well with freshly ground black pepper. (Season with salt to taste - the bacon will make it quite salty so watch out when seasoning with salt.). If using the lemon juice pour over the top of the chicken breasts now. Scatter or arrange the cherry tomatoes around the chicken pieces. (I like to keep them on the vine.). Place in the middle of a pre-heated oven and roast for between 45 - 55 minutes; the cooking time depends on the size of the chicken breasts and your oven. Remove from the oven and place the chicken breasts on a plate - you can serve them whole or sliced. Garnish with watercress as well as the roasted cherry tomatoes. Serve with a selection of seasonal fresh vegetables and a jacket potato making sure you spoon the excess Boursin sauce over the top of the chicken pieces and the roasted cherry tomatoes! Tip:You can make an optional creamy sauce. On taking the chicken out of the oven add the creme fraiche and white wine to the Boursin cooking juices in the oven dish whisk together and then gently heat whisking all the time over medium heat on top of the stove or decant the creme fraiche wine and juices to a small saucepan and heat the sauce in the pan. (Make sure to keep the chicken warm whilst you do this.). TO FREEZE: As soon as you have stuffed and wrapped the bacon around the beaten chicken breasts wrap individually in cling film and put into a freezer container or a freezer bag. Take them out as required and allow to defrost for 4-5 hours at room temperature or overnight in the fridge. Cook as above. Can be frozen for up to 3 months with no adverse effects on the Boursin cheese.",3.72,4.6923076923076925,2.0,NO,NO,NO,NO,0.9723076923076923,2,non-vegetarian vs non-vegetarian,non-vegan vs non-vegan

Ingredients: corned beef brisket, peppercorn, cabbage, fresh carrot, fresh parsley, real butter, fresh garlic clove, sweet onion, yellow mustard, N .y. C. Irish Soda Bread.
Instructions: ------------Selecting the corned beef brisket------------. Go to the store several days ahead of time or you will have to pick out the best of what has been picked over again and again. The best will disappear first. Do not freeze. Pick out a nice thick slab checking the sides to make sure it isn't a very gristly one. Feel it because some butchers fold it over hiding the gristle if there is a lot of it. There will always be some gristle and it runs the length of the slab in the center. The thicker the slab the better. If you are lucky you may see some chunk style at a higher price per pound. If there isn't a spice bag in with the brisket you will need to get some whole peppercorns (white and black) and bay leaves. ------------Selecting the Cabbage-------------------. The heavier and more solid it is the better it is. Smell it to make sure it isn't too bitter. You may have to go to another store if the whole batch has a very strong bitter smell. I have had to visit several stores to find a decent batch. Keep in mind that the outer leaves will be discarded even if the store has already removed the natural outer leaves to make them look better and fresher. --------------Selecting the Potatoes----------------. Watch out for the red dyed ones. Pick out a bag of medium to small sized ones. The smaller the better. If you are lucky enough to find the ones as small as salad tomatoes they are the best. -------------Selecting the Carrots----------. Get the smallest bag they have unless you like carrots because you will only use one per pot of cabbage to take any bitterness out of the cabbage. Serving a bowl of carrots is a big no no on Saint Patrick's Day. Preparing and cooking the meal-----------------------. (It's going to take 3 hours with you there). Use a large Dutch oven or stock pot that will hold everything all at once. Place the brisket (best side up) in the bottom of the pot. There's no need to rinse it because nothing bad will survive what you are about to do to it and you will remove the outer marinate. Add the spice packet or a teaspoonful of peppercorns and two bay leaves. Cover the brisket generously with water and a bottle of beer (optional - adds flavor and is a tenderizer). Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 2 hours. During the 2 hours------------------------. Scrub and rinse the new red potatoes. Remove any eyes and bad spots. Leave as much of the peel as you can. Quarter them (halve or whole if tiny). Cover with water until ready for them. Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage until the leaves are entirely light green rinse and cut it into quarters through the spine so they stay together.  Set aside. Peel one carrot and cut it into quarters.  Set aside. Peel the onion and cut it into eighths.  Set aside. Rinse the bunch of fresh parsley and chop up just the tops into very tiny pieces. I find that kitchen scissors do just fine. After the 2 hours----------------------. Add the potatoes on top of the brisket. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the cabbage on top of the potatoes and add onion and carrot on top of the cabbage. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Check the cabbage to see if it is tender. If not simmer another 5 minutes. You shouldn't undercook it and it's hard to overcook it. When done-----------------------. In a large serving bowl where you can stir the potatoes crush the garlic clove and rub the inside of the bowl with it. Place the potatoes in the bowl while still piping hot and add (at least) a quarter pound of butter and add a handful (more is better than less) of chopped fresh parsley. Gently stir until butter is melted it coats all the potato pieces and the parsley is evenly distributed. Put the rest of the parsley into a tiny serving bowl for those who want to add more to their potatoes. As I said more is better. Slice the brisket cross grain. Hope there is leftovers for breakfast.

Finely chopped fried corned beef and cabbage (the entire meal) and coffee is divine. We throw in any leftover parsley.","Black Bean and Couscous Salad

Ingredients: corned beef brisket, peppercorn, cabbage, fresh carrot, fresh parsley, real butter, fresh garlic clove, sweet onion, yellow mustard, N .y. C. Irish Soda Bread.
Instructions: ------------Selecting the corned beef brisket------------. Go to the store several days ahead of time or you will have to pick out the best of what has been picked over again and again. The best will disappear first. Do not freeze. Pick out a nice thick slab checking the sides to make sure it isn't a very gristly one. Feel it because some butchers fold it over hiding the gristle if there is a lot of it. There will always be some gristle and it runs the length of the slab in the center. The thicker the slab the better. If you are lucky you may see some chunk style at a higher price per pound. If there isn't a spice bag in with the brisket you will need to get some whole peppercorns (white and black) and bay leaves. ------------Selecting the Cabbage-------------------. The heavier and more solid it is the better it is. Smell it to make sure it isn't too bitter. You may have to go to another store if the whole batch has a very strong bitter smell. I have had to visit several stores to find a decent batch. Keep in mind that the outer leaves will be discarded even if the store has already removed the natural outer leaves to make them look better and fresher. --------------Selecting the Potatoes----------------. Watch out for the red dyed ones. Pick out a bag of medium to small sized ones. The smaller the better. If you are lucky enough to find the ones as small as salad tomatoes they are the best. -------------Selecting the Carrots----------. Get the smallest bag they have unless you like carrots because you will only use one per pot of cabbage to take any bitterness out of the cabbage. Serving a bowl of carrots is a big no no on Saint Patrick's Day. Preparing and cooking the meal-----------------------. (It's going to take 3 hours with you there). Use a large Dutch oven or stock pot that will hold everything all at once. Place the brisket (best side up) in the bottom of the pot. There's no need to rinse it because nothing bad will survive what you are about to do to it and you will remove the outer marinate.

Ingredients: london broil beef, black pepper, chili powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, onion powder, liquid smoke, soy sauce, low sodium soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce.
Instructions: Trim all fat off meat. Cut steak in to 4 inch strips. The steak should be about 1/2 inch thick. It's easier to cut meat partially frozen. Pound meat lightly you don't want it too thin. Add all ingredients in a large bowl. Mix well. Cover and refrigerate overnight (8 hrs). Line cookie sheets with tin foil. Place steak strips on sheets don't overlap meat. Set oven at lowest temperature. (150-175°F). Bake six hours turning after three hours. Jerky is done when meat is dried out depending on your oven.

Ingredients: corned beef brisket, peppercorn, cabbage, fresh carrot, fresh parsley, real butter, fresh garlic clove, sweet onion, yellow mustard, N .y. C. Irish Soda Bread.
Instructions: ------------Selecting the corned beef brisket------------. Go to the store several days ahead of time or you will have to pick out the best of what has been picked over again and again. The best will disappear first. Do not freeze. Pick out a nice thick slab checking the sides to make sure it isn't a very gristly one. Feel it because some butchers fold it over hiding the gristle if there is a lot of it. There will always be some gristle and it runs the length of the slab in the center. The thicker the slab the better. If you are lucky you may see some chunk style at a higher price per pound. If there isn't a spice bag in with the brisket you will need to get some whole peppercorns (white and black) and bay leaves. ------------Selecting the Cabbage-------------------. The heavier and more solid it is the better it is. Smell it to make sure it isn't too bitter. You may have to go to another store if the whole batch has a very strong bitter smell. I have had to visit several stores to find a decent batch. Keep in mind that the outer leaves will be discarded even if the store has already removed the natural outer leaves to make them look better and fresher. --------------Selecting the Potatoes----------------. Watch out for the red dyed ones. Pick out a bag of medium to small sized ones. The smaller the better. If you are lucky enough to find the ones as small as salad tomatoes they are the best. -------------Selecting the Carrots----------. Get the smallest bag they have unless you like carrots because you will only use one per pot of cabbage to take any bitterness out of the cabbage. Serving a bowl of carrots is a big no no on Saint Patrick's Day. Preparing and cooking the meal-----------------------. (It's going to take 3 hours with you there). Use a large Dutch oven or stock pot that will hold everything all at once. Place the brisket (best side up) in the bottom of the pot. There's no need to rinse it because nothing bad will survive what you are about to do to it and you will remove the outer marinate. Add the spice packet or a teaspoonful of peppercorns and two bay leaves. Cover the brisket generously with water and a bottle of beer (optional - adds flavor and is a tenderizer). Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 2 hours. During the 2 hours------------------------. Scrub and rinse the new red potatoes. Remove any eyes and bad spots. Leave as much of the peel as you can. Quarter them (halve or whole if tiny). Cover with water until ready for them. Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage until the leaves are entirely light green rinse and cut it into quarters through the spine so they stay together.  Set aside. Peel one carrot and cut it into quarters.  Set aside. Peel the onion and cut it into eighths.  Set aside. Rinse the bunch of fresh parsley and chop up just the tops into very tiny pieces. I find that kitchen scissors do just fine. After the 2 hours----------------------. Add the potatoes on top of the brisket. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the cabbage on top of the potatoes and add onion and carrot on top of the cabbage. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Check the cabbage to see if it is tender. If not simmer another 5 minutes. You shouldn't undercook it and it's hard to overcook it. When done-----------------------. In a large serving bowl where you can stir the potatoes crush the garlic clove and rub the inside of the bowl with it. Place the potatoes in the bowl while still piping hot and add (at least) a quarter pound of butter and add a handful (more is better than less) of chopped fresh parsley. Gently stir until butter is melted it coats all the potato pieces and the parsley is evenly distributed. Put the rest of the parsley into a tiny serving bowl for those who want to add more to their potatoes. As I said more is better. Slice the brisket cross grain. Hope there is leftovers for breakfast.

Ingredients: whole chickens, water, poultry seasoning, garlic powder, black pepper, celery ribs, green onions, onion, carrot, chicken bouillon cubes, flour, baking powder, poultry seasoning, salt, margarine, butter flavor shortening, eggs.
Instructions: Place whole chicken and water into large pot or dutch oven. Add poultry seasoning garlic powder& pepper. Bring to boil and reduce heat to medium. Cook chicken for about 1 hour or until tender. When done carefully remove chicken from pot; set aside to cool. Remove 2 cups of stock and set aside to cool. Add celery onion carrot and bouillon cubes to remaining stock and continue to cook on simmer. While chicken is cooling prepare dumplings. Into large mixing bowl combine flour baking powder poultry seasoning and salt. Add margarine and combine until mixture is coarse and crumbly. (use a hand mixer) Add eggs and cooled chicken stock (be sure your stock has cooled to\""just barely warm\"") then stir by hand to form a dough. Turn out onto floured surface and knead slightly until smooth. You may need to divide dough in half and only roll out half at a time. Roll out to approximately 1/8-inch thickness. Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter cut dough in vertical strips about an inch wide. Then repeat the process cutting horizontal strips which will give you little square dumplings. Return chicken stock to a boil; drop dumplings in a few at a time as quickly as possible. Cook about 15 minutes stirring occasionally to prevent dumplings from sticking to bottom of pan. When done remove from heat and cover pan. Remove skin and debone cooled chicken. Cut into bite size pieces then fold into hot dumplings & broth.

Ingredients: corned beef brisket, peppercorn, cabbage, fresh carrot, fresh parsley, real butter, fresh garlic clove, sweet onion, yellow mustard, N .y. C. Irish Soda Bread.
Instructions: ------------Selecting the corned beef brisket------------. Go to the store several days ahead of time or you will have to pick out the best of what has been picked over again and again. The best will disappear first. Do not freeze. Pick out a nice thick slab checking the sides to make sure it isn't a very gristly one. Feel it because some butchers fold it over hiding the gristle if there is a lot of it. There will always be some gristle and it runs the length of the slab in the center. The thicker the slab the better. If you are lucky you may see some chunk style at a higher price per pound. If there isn't a spice bag in with the brisket you will need to get some whole peppercorns (white and black) and bay leaves. ------------Selecting the Cabbage-------------------. The heavier and more solid it is the better it is. Smell it to make sure it isn't too bitter. You may have to go to another store if the whole batch has a very strong bitter smell. I have had to visit several stores to find a decent batch. Keep in mind that the outer leaves will be discarded even if the store has already removed the natural outer leaves to make them look better and fresher. --------------Selecting the Potatoes----------------. Watch out for the red dyed ones. Pick out a bag of medium to small sized ones. The smaller the better. If you are lucky enough to find the ones as small as salad tomatoes they are the best. -------------Selecting the Carrots----------. Get the smallest bag they have unless you like carrots because you will only use one per pot of cabbage to take any bitterness out of the cabbage. Serving a bowl of carrots is a big no no on Saint Patrick's Day. Preparing and cooking the meal-----------------------. (It's going to take 3 hours with you there). Use a large Dutch oven or stock pot that will hold everything all at once. Place the brisket (best side up) in the bottom of the pot. There's no need to rinse it because nothing bad will survive what you are about to do to it and you will remove the outer marinate. Add the spice packet or a teaspoonful of peppercorns and two bay leaves. Cover the brisket generously with water and a bottle of beer (optional - adds flavor and is a tenderizer). Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 2 hours. During the 2 hours------------------------. Scrub and rinse the new red potatoes. Remove any eyes and bad spots. Leave as much of the peel as you can. Quarter them (halve or whole if tiny). Cover with water until ready for them. Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage until the leaves are entirely light green rinse and cut it into quarters through the spine so they stay together.  Set aside. Peel one carrot and cut it into quarters.  Set aside. Peel the onion and cut it into eighths.  Set aside. Rinse the bunch of fresh parsley and chop up just the tops into very tiny pieces. I find that kitchen scissors do just fine. After the 2 hours----------------------. Add the potatoes on top of the brisket. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the cabbage on top of the potatoes and add onion and carrot on top of the cabbage. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Check the cabbage to see if it is tender. If not simmer another 5 minutes. You shouldn't undercook it and it's hard to overcook it. When done-----------------------. In a large serving bowl where you can stir the potatoes crush the garlic clove and rub the inside of the bowl with it. Place the potatoes in the bowl while still piping hot and add (at least) a quarter pound of butter and add a handful (more is better than less) of chopped fresh parsley. Gently stir until butter is melted it coats all the potato pieces and the parsley is evenly distributed. Put the rest of the parsley into a tiny serving bowl for those who want to add more to their potatoes. As I said more is better. Slice the brisket cross grain. Hope there is leftovers for breakfast.

Ingredients: corned beef brisket, peppercorn, cabbage, fresh carrot, fresh parsley, real butter, fresh garlic clove, sweet onion, yellow mustard, N .y. C. Irish Soda Bread.
Instructions: ------------Selecting the corned beef brisket------------. Go to the store several days ahead of time or you will have to pick out the best of what has been picked over again and again. The best will disappear first. Do not freeze. Pick out a nice thick slab checking the sides to make sure it isn't a very gristly one. Feel it because some butchers fold it over hiding the gristle if there is a lot of it. There will always be some gristle and it runs the length of the slab in the center. The thicker the slab the better. If you are lucky you may see some chunk style at a higher price per pound. If there isn't a spice bag in with the brisket you will need to get some whole peppercorns (white and black) and bay leaves. ------------Selecting the Cabbage-------------------. The heavier and more solid it is the better it is. Smell it to make sure it isn't too bitter. You may have to go to another store if the whole batch has a very strong bitter smell. I have had to visit several stores to find a decent batch. Keep in mind that the outer leaves will be discarded even if the store has already removed the natural outer leaves to make them look better and fresher. --------------Selecting the Potatoes----------------. Watch out for the red dyed ones. Pick out a bag of medium to small sized ones. The smaller the better. If you are lucky enough to find the ones as small as salad tomatoes they are the best. -------------Selecting the Carrots----------. Get the smallest bag they have unless you like carrots because you will only use one per pot of cabbage to take any bitterness out of the cabbage. Serving a bowl of carrots is a big no no on Saint Patrick's Day. Preparing and cooking the meal-----------------------. (It's going to take 3 hours with you there). Use a large Dutch oven or stock pot that will hold everything all at once. Place the brisket (best side up) in the bottom of the pot. There's no need to rinse it because nothing bad will survive what you are about to do to it and you will remove the outer marinate. Add the spice packet or a teaspoonful of peppercorns and two bay leaves. Cover the brisket generously with water and a bottle of beer (optional - adds flavor and is a tenderizer). Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 2 hours. During the 2 hours------------------------. Scrub and rinse the new red potatoes. Remove any eyes and bad spots. Leave as much of the peel as you can. Quarter them (halve or whole if tiny). Cover with water until ready for them. Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage until the leaves are entirely light green rinse and cut it into quarters through the spine so they stay together.  Set aside. Peel one carrot and cut it into quarters.  Set aside. Peel the onion and cut it into eighths.  Set aside. Rinse the bunch of fresh parsley and chop up just the tops into very tiny pieces. I find that kitchen scissors do just fine. After the 2 hours----------------------. Add the potatoes on top of the brisket. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the cabbage on top of the potatoes and add onion and carrot on top of the cabbage. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Check the cabbage to see if it is tender. If not simmer another 5 minutes. You shouldn't undercook it and it's hard to overcook it. When done-----------------------. In a large serving bowl where you can stir the potatoes crush the garlic clove and rub the inside of the bowl with it. Place the potatoes in the bowl while still piping hot and add (at least) a quarter pound of butter and add a handful (more is better than less) of chopped fresh parsley. Gently stir until butter is melted it coats all the potato pieces and the parsley is evenly distributed. Put the rest of the parsley into a tiny serving bowl for those who want to add more to their potatoes. As I said more is better. Slice the brisket cross grain. Hope there is leftovers for breakfast. See my March 18th Breakfast! It's a family tradition. We make sure we make enough to ensure leftovers for breakfast the next morning. Finely chopped fried corned beef and cabbage (the entire meal) and coffee is divine. We throw in any leftover parsley.","Gallo Pinto (Costa Rican Rice and Beans)
Ingredients: canola oil, onion, garlic cloves, cooked white rice, black beans, ground cumin, ground coriander, ground ginger, vegetarian worcestershire sauce, fresh cilantro, green onion.
Instructions: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until it just begins to soften and turns color. Add garlic and sauté for about 5 minutes or until onion is golden. Add spices and Worcestershire and stir into onion and garlic. (The first time I made this I was afraid to add the full 3 Tbsp of Worcestershire but the addition of the rice balances the flavor out). Next add the beans and then the rice. Combine the rice and beans evenly and cook until mixture is heated through. Add salt and pepper to taste and serve hot.

Instructions: ------------Selecting the corned beef brisket------------. Go to the store several days ahead of time or you will have to pick out the best of what has been picked over again and again. The best will disappear first. Do not freeze. Pick out a nice thick slab checking the sides to make sure it isn't a very gristly one. Feel it because some butchers fold it over hiding the gristle if there is a lot of it. There will always be some gristle and it runs the length of the slab in the center. The thicker the slab the better. If you are lucky you may see some chunk style at a higher price per pound. If there isn't a spice bag in with the brisket you will need to get some whole peppercorns (white and black) and bay leaves. ------------Selecting the Cabbage-------------------. The heavier and more solid it is the better it is. Smell it to make sure it isn't too bitter. You may have to go to another store if the whole batch has a very strong bitter smell. I have had to visit several stores to find a decent batch. Keep in mind that the outer leaves will be discarded even if the store has already removed the natural outer leaves to make them look better and fresher. --------------Selecting the Potatoes----------------. Watch out for the red dyed ones. Pick out a bag of medium to small sized ones. The smaller the better. If you are lucky enough to find the ones as small as salad tomatoes they are the best. -------------Selecting the Carrots----------. Get the smallest bag they have unless you like carrots because you will only use one per pot of cabbage to take any bitterness out of the cabbage. Serving a bowl of carrots is a big no no on Saint Patrick's Day. Preparing and cooking the meal-----------------------. (It's going to take 3 hours with you there). Use a large Dutch oven or stock pot that will hold everything all at once. Place the brisket (best side up) in the bottom of the pot. There's no need to rinse it because nothing bad will survive what you are about to do to it and you will remove the outer marinate. Add the spice packet or a teaspoonful of peppercorns and two bay leaves. Cover the brisket generously with water and a bottle of beer (optional - adds flavor and is a tenderizer). Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 2 hours. During the 2 hours------------------------. Scrub and rinse the new red potatoes. Remove any eyes and bad spots. Leave as much of the peel as you can. Quarter them (halve or whole if tiny). Cover with water until ready for them. Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage until the leaves are entirely light green rinse and cut it into quarters through the spine so they stay together.  Set aside. Peel one carrot and cut it into quarters.  Set aside. Peel the onion and cut it into eighths.  Set aside. Rinse the bunch of fresh parsley and chop up just the tops into very tiny pieces. I find that kitchen scissors do just fine. After the 2 hours----------------------. Add the potatoes on top of the brisket. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the cabbage on top of the potatoes and add onion and carrot on top of the cabbage. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Check the cabbage to see if it is tender. If not simmer another 5 minutes. You shouldn't undercook it and it's hard to overcook it. When done-----------------------. In a large serving bowl where you can stir the potatoes crush the garlic clove and rub the inside of the bowl with it. Place the potatoes in the bowl while still piping hot and add (at least) a quarter pound of butter and add a handful (more is better than less) of chopped fresh parsley. Gently stir until butter is melted it coats all the potato pieces and the parsley is evenly distributed. Put the rest of the parsley into a tiny serving bowl for those who want to add more to their potatoes. As I said more is better. Slice the brisket cross grain. Hope there is leftovers for breakfast. See my March 18th Breakfast! It's a family tradition. We make sure we make enough to ensure leftovers for breakfast the next morning. Finely chopped fried corned beef and cabbage (the entire meal) and coffee is divine. We throw in any leftover parsley.","Crook's Corner Shrimp and Grits

The thicker the slab the better. If you are lucky you may see some chunk style at a higher price per pound. If there isn't a spice bag in with the brisket you will need to get some whole peppercorns (white and black) and bay leaves. ------------Selecting the Cabbage-------------------. The heavier and more solid it is the better it is. Smell it to make sure it isn't too bitter. You may have to go to another store if the whole batch has a very strong bitter smell. I have had to visit several stores to find a decent batch. Keep in mind that the outer leaves will be discarded even if the store has already removed the natural outer leaves to make them look better and fresher. --------------Selecting the Potatoes----------------. Watch out for the red dyed ones. Pick out a bag of medium to small sized ones. The smaller the better. If you are lucky enough to find the ones as small as salad tomatoes they are the best. -------------Selecting the Carrots----------. Get the smallest bag they have unless you like carrots because you will only use one per pot of cabbage to take any bitterness out of the cabbage. Serving a bowl of carrots is a big no no on Saint Patrick's Day. Preparing and cooking the meal-----------------------. (It's going to take 3 hours with you there). Use a large Dutch oven or stock pot that will hold everything all at once. Place the brisket (best side up) in the bottom of the pot. There's no need to rinse it because nothing bad will survive what you are about to do to it and you will remove the outer marinate. Add the spice packet or a teaspoonful of peppercorns and two bay leaves. Cover the brisket generously with water and a bottle of beer (optional - adds flavor and is a tenderizer). Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 2 hours. During the 2 hours------------------------. Scrub and rinse the new red potatoes. Remove any eyes and bad spots. Leave as much of the peel as you can. Quarter them (halve or whole if tiny). Cover with water until ready for them. Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage until the leaves are entirely light green rinse and cut it into quarters through the spine so they stay together.  Set aside. Peel one carrot and cut it into quarters.  Set aside. Peel the onion and cut it into eighths.  Set aside. Rinse the bunch of fresh parsley and chop up just the tops into very tiny pieces. I find that kitchen scissors do just fine. After the 2 hours----------------------. Add the potatoes on top of the brisket. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the cabbage on top of the potatoes and add onion and carrot on top of the cabbage. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Check the cabbage to see if it is tender. If not simmer another 5 minutes. You shouldn't undercook it and it's hard to overcook it. When done-----------------------. In a large serving bowl where you can stir the potatoes crush the garlic clove and rub the inside of the bowl with it. Place the potatoes in the bowl while still piping hot and add (at least) a quarter pound of butter and add a handful (more is better than less) of chopped fresh parsley. Gently stir until butter is melted it coats all the potato pieces and the parsley is evenly distributed. Put the rest of the parsley into a tiny serving bowl for those who want to add more to their potatoes. As I said more is better. Slice the brisket cross grain. Hope there is leftovers for breakfast. See my March 18th Breakfast! It's a family tradition. We make sure we make enough to ensure leftovers for breakfast the next morning. Finely chopped fried corned beef and cabbage (the entire meal) and coffee is divine. We throw in any leftover parsley.","Haricot Vert - French Green Beans With Garlic and Sliced Almonds

The best will disappear first. Do not freeze. Pick out a nice thick slab checking the sides to make sure it isn't a very gristly one. Feel it because some butchers fold it over hiding the gristle if there is a lot of it. There will always be some gristle and it runs the length of the slab in the center. The thicker the slab the better. If you are lucky you may see some chunk style at a higher price per pound. If there isn't a spice bag in with the brisket you will need to get some whole peppercorns (white and black) and bay leaves. ------------Selecting the Cabbage-------------------. The heavier and more solid it is the better it is. Smell it to make sure it isn't too bitter. You may have to go to another store if the whole batch has a very strong bitter smell. I have had to visit several stores to find a decent batch. Keep in mind that the outer leaves will be discarded even if the store has already removed the natural outer leaves to make them look better and fresher. --------------Selecting the Potatoes----------------. Watch out for the red dyed ones. Pick out a bag of medium to small sized ones. The smaller the better. If you are lucky enough to find the ones as small as salad tomatoes they are the best. -------------Selecting the Carrots----------. Get the smallest bag they have unless you like carrots because you will only use one per pot of cabbage to take any bitterness out of the cabbage. Serving a bowl of carrots is a big no no on Saint Patrick's Day. Preparing and cooking the meal-----------------------. (It's going to take 3 hours with you there). Use a large Dutch oven or stock pot that will hold everything all at once. Place the brisket (best side up) in the bottom of the pot. There's no need to rinse it because nothing bad will survive what you are about to do to it and you will remove the outer marinate. Add the spice packet or a teaspoonful of peppercorns and two bay leaves. Cover the brisket generously with water and a bottle of beer (optional - adds flavor and is a tenderizer). Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 2 hours. During the 2 hours------------------------. Scrub and rinse the new red potatoes. Remove any eyes and bad spots. Leave as much of the peel as you can. Quarter them (halve or whole if tiny). Cover with water until ready for them. Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage until the leaves are entirely light green rinse and cut it into quarters through the spine so they stay together.  Set aside. Peel one carrot and cut it into quarters.  Set aside. Peel the onion and cut it into eighths.  Set aside. Rinse the bunch of fresh parsley and chop up just the tops into very tiny pieces. I find that kitchen scissors do just fine. After the 2 hours----------------------. Add the potatoes on top of the brisket. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the cabbage on top of the potatoes and add onion and carrot on top of the cabbage. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Check the cabbage to see if it is tender. If not simmer another 5 minutes. You shouldn't undercook it and it's hard to overcook it. When done-----------------------. In a large serving bowl where you can stir the potatoes crush the garlic clove and rub the inside of the bowl with it. Place the potatoes in the bowl while still piping hot and add (at least) a quarter pound of butter and add a handful (more is better than less) of chopped fresh parsley. Gently stir until butter is melted it coats all the potato pieces and the parsley is evenly distributed. Put the rest of the parsley into a tiny serving bowl for those who want to add more to their potatoes. As I said more is better. Slice the brisket cross grain. Hope there is leftovers for breakfast. See my March 18th Breakfast! It's a family tradition. We make sure we make enough to ensure leftovers for breakfast the next morning. Finely chopped fried corned beef and cabbage (the entire meal) and coffee is divine. We throw in any leftover parsley.","Easy Crock Pot Moroccan Chicken, Chickpea and Apricot Tagine
Ingredients: boneless skinless chicken breasts, flour, cornflour, onions, garlic cloves, extra virgin olive oil, tomato paste, chopped tomatoes, chickpeas, honey, saffron, turmeric, ras el hanout spice mix, ground coriander, ground cinnamon, ground cumin, cayenne pepper, fresh coriander, carrots, preserved lemon, harissa.
Instructions: PLEASE NOTE: This recipe lists canned chickpeas in the ingredients NOT dried! If you use dried chickpeas you MUST soak them and cook them first! Heat up olive oil in a frying pan/skillet & saute chopped onions & garlic for 5-10 minutes. Add chicken stock & gradually mix in flour or cornflour until well mixed & not lumpy.Add honey & tomato paste & mix well. Add herbs,spices & finely chopped ginger with salt & pepper to taste. Finally add tinned tomatoes & mix well. Pour the above tomato,onion & spice mix into slow cooker or tagine. Add chicken & chickpeas & mix well. Add dried apricots making sure they are covered by juice. (Add the carrots if using.). Give it a gentle but good stir to mix everything together well. Crock Pot or Slow Cooker - Cook on high for about 3 to 4 hours OR automatic with keep warm facility for up to 8 hours. (Please note that the cooking times depend on your crockpot the cooking times I have suggested work fine with mine which is a Morphy Richards Slow Cooker.). If cooking in a Traditional Tagine do as above & cook SLOWLY over gas or barbeque for about 2-3 hours. Electric Tagine cooking - same as the slowcooker. If you need to thicken it up towards the end of the cooking time add cornflour which has been mixed with a little water & add to the tagine - mix well. Serve with freshly chopped Coriander/Cilantro sprinked on top & either with couscous rice fresh flat bread pitta bread or salads. It is also good (if not traditional) served with fluffy pureed or mashed potatoes & pasta. Note: You can use chicken pieces or whole chicken which has been cut up into portions but you will then need to brown them in a frying pan or skillet beforehand. Preserved lemons make a great addition add them when you add the apricots and carrots.",3.835714285714286,4.542553191489362,2.0,NO,NO,NO,NO,0.7068389057750761,1,non-vegetarian vs non-vegetarian,non-vegan vs non-vegan

Ingredients: cod fish fillets, haddock fillets, plain flour, bicarbonate of soda, beer, flour, potatoes.
Instructions: Heat fat up in a chip pan or automatic deep fat fryer - mine has a chip setting which is 190°C. Peel the potatoes and cut into chunky sized chips. Rinse and dry thoroughly. Fry chips for about 3 minutes until soft but NOT coloured. Drain and shake well and set to one side. Put some flour onto a plate. Dredge the fish fillets in the flour thoroughly - this is VERY important it stops the batter sliding off when fried! Leave the fish fillets in the flour whilst you make the batter. Some people say you should make the batter at least one hour before - I have found little difference - so make it before if it is convenient or now! Put flour bicarbonate of soda salt and pepper into a large roomy bowl. Add the beer gradually stop when you have a thick coating type of batter. Drink any beer that is left! Whisk thoroughly until it is smooth and there are no lumps.Add the lemon juice OR a splash of malt vinegar if desired. Mix thoroughly again. Have your plates newspaper or whatever ready for eating! Adjust deep fat fryer to fish frying temperature of 160°C. Take one fillet of fish at a time and holding it by the tail or thin end (!) swirl it around the batter until well coated - plunge into hot fat immediately. As soon as it has crisped up and set add your other fillets one at a time taking out the first ones as they cook - about 6 to 10 minutes depending on the thickness. Place onto a tray and keep warm in the oven. Turn up the heat setting to 190°C again and cook your chips until golden and crisp. Serve on plates or newspaper with salt & vinegar! All you need now is a pint of warm beer and Coronation Street on the TV to set the scene!

Ingredients: beef, olive oil, onion, garlic cloves, carrot, canned tomatoes, dates, prunes, honey, cinnamon stick, ras el hanout spice mix, fresh coriander.
Instructions: Par-boil the carrots in boiling water for about 3 -5 minutes. Preheat the electric Tagine or crock pot to High. Heat up half of the olive oil in a large frying pan and quickly brown the onion quarters over a fairly high heat until charred & coloured well. Tip them into the crock pot. Add the chopped garlic & par-boiled carrots to the onions in the crock pot. Make up 1/2 pint of stock with a beef stock cube. Add the honey to the the stock & ALL the dried spices. Tip the honey & spiced stock into the crock pot & mix well. Add the cinnamon stick. Add the tinned tomatoes dates & prunes to the crock pot - mix well. Heat up the remaining olive oil and brown the beef cubes in small batches to sear & seal them. As you finish browning them add the beef to the crock pot. When you have finished browning all the beef give the whole mixture a good stir & season with salt & pepper. Cook on high for between 6 & 10 hours depending on your crock pot's wattage & settings. Serve the beef tagine with fluffy couscous and garnish with the chopped fresh coriander & toasted flaked almonds. It also works well with rice too. P.S. Watch out for the cinnamon stick! We sometimes award the lucky winner of the cinnamon stick with an extra glass of wine! P.P.S. You can use dates & prunes which have not been pitted they do tend to hold their shape better too just warn your guests that they must look out for the stones!",3.835714285714286,4.584905660377358,2.0,NO,NO,NO,NO,0.7491913746630723,1,non-vegetarian vs non-vegetarian,non-vegan vs non-vegan
367,367,15846,254299,"N. Y. C. Corned Beef and Cabbage
Ingredients: corned beef brisket, peppercorn, cabbage, fresh carrot, fresh parsley, real butter, fresh garlic clove, sweet onion, yellow mustard, N .y. C. Irish Soda Bread.
Instructions: ------------Selecting the corned beef brisket------------. Go to the store several days ahead of time or you will have to pick out the best of what has been picked over again and again. The best will disappear first. Do not freeze. Pick out a nice thick slab checking the sides to make sure it isn't a very gristly one. Feel it because some butchers fold it over hiding the gristle if there is a lot of it. There will always be some gristle and it runs the length of the slab in the center. The thicker the slab the better. If you are lucky you may see some chunk style at a higher price per pound. If there isn't a spice bag in with the brisket you will need to get some whole peppercorns (white and black) and bay leaves. ------------Selecting the Cabbage-------------------. The heavier and more solid it is the better it is. Smell it to make sure it isn't too bitter. You may have to go to another store if the whole batch has a very strong bitter smell. I have had to visit several stores to find a decent batch. Keep in mind that the outer leaves will be discarded even if the store has already removed the natural outer leaves to make them look better and fresher. --------------Selecting the Potatoes----------------. Watch out for the red dyed ones. Pick out a bag of medium to small sized ones. The smaller the better. If you are lucky enough to find the ones as small as salad tomatoes they are the best. -------------Selecting the Carrots----------. Get the smallest bag they have unless you like carrots because you will only use one per pot of cabbage to take any bitterness out of the cabbage. Serving a bowl of carrots is a big no no on Saint Patrick's Day. Preparing and cooking the meal-----------------------. (It's going to take 3 hours with you there). Use a large Dutch oven or stock pot that will hold everything all at once. Place the brisket (best side up) in the bottom of the pot. There's no need to rinse it because nothing bad will survive what you are about to do to it and you will remove the outer marinate. Add the spice packet or a teaspoonful of peppercorns and two bay leaves. Cover the brisket generously with water and a bottle of beer (optional - adds flavor and is a tenderizer). Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 2 hours. During the 2 hours------------------------. Scrub and rinse the new red potatoes. Remove any eyes and bad spots. Leave as much of the peel as you can. Quarter them (halve or whole if tiny). Cover with water until ready for them. Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage until the leaves are entirely light green rinse and cut it into quarters through the spine so they stay together.  Set aside. Peel one carrot and cut it into quarters.  Set aside. Peel the onion and cut it into eighths.  Set aside. Rinse the bunch of fresh parsley and chop up just the tops into very tiny pieces. I find that kitchen scissors do just fine. After the 2 hours----------------------. Add the potatoes on top of the brisket. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the cabbage on top of the potatoes and add onion and carrot on top of the cabbage. Add water to cover everything. Bring to a boil.

Ingredients: mayonnaise, tomatoes, turkey breast, cheese slice, black olives, purple onion.
Instructions: Cut loaf of bread in half horizontally and hollow out the soft bread from both halves leaving a shell about 3/4-inch thick. Reserve soft bread for another use. In small bowl combine artichoke liquid with mayonnaise and spread onto bread shells. In bottom half layer ingredients at least three times until mounded high beginning and ending with tomatoes. Place top half of bread over mound of ingredients. Wrap entire loaf tightly with plastic wrap. This must be assembled at least 2 hours before serving but can be assembled up to 8 hours before serving. Refrigerate. Before serving place sandwich (wrapped in plastic) on a hard surface and SIT ON IT!  This smashes the ingredients together and makes it easier to serve.  Do not omit this step strange as it seems as this step is what makes the sandwich delicious. Slice the loaf into wedges or slices to serve. Note:  I usually roughly chop the artichoke hearts myself.  Also regarding the artichoke juice mixture:  you can add only half of it to the mayo if you like - how much of the spread you're going to need depends on the size of loaf you've gotten. Note #2:  other good additions I've made to the sandwich include strips of roasted red and yellow pepper whole fresh basil leaves (placed on top of the tomatoes) or pesto into the mayo pepperoncini and/or sliced sweet red cherry peppers pancetta and more salami or other hard sausage than the recipe calls for. Note #3:  any leftover mayo mixture by the way makes a great salad dressing!  I once accidentally used the juice from a jar larger than the recipe called for and the mixture was far more than I needed --  so to thicken it up a bit I added a bit of lowfat sour cream and made the leftover mixture (much to my husband's delight) available as salad dressing.

Cook continuously flipping the meat over and slightly chopping the meat into slightly smaller pieces with 2 spatulas until the meat is not pink which should take about 2 minutes.

If using Italian or French bread cut the bread in half crosswise and slice lengthwise to open for the 2 sandwiches.
