Here's why, even without seeing actual reviews:

* **Recipe 2 is shorter, punchier, and emphasizes ease.** The title itself (""Stupid Easy"") targets a specific audience looking for effortless recipes. 
* **Recipe 2 speaks directly to the reader.** Using phrases like ""your family likes"" and ""we like them on"" creates a conversational and relatable tone.
* **Recipe 1, while potentially delicious, is lengthy.** Online readers often skim."

* **Recipe 1 is very basic.**  While it might be tasty, it doesn't have the hallmarks of a recipe that would generate a lot of buzz and positive reviews: unique flavor combinations, interesting techniques, or a focus on visual appeal.
* **Recipe 2 is more complex and specific.** It has more ingredients, detailed instructions, and even cultural references.  People are more likely to leave detailed reviews when a recipe is more"
